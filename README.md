# server-nodeJS
This server allows you to create a full-fledged multi-page site based on just one page, which is used as a template.

When displaying any page of the site, a layout is taken, into which the necessary data and resources are then inserted. This greatly facilitates the process of making any changes to this site.

To run, you must have Node JS on your computer. In the terminal, go to the server directory and enter the command node index.js. Open your browser at http://localhost:3000/index
